    <br>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>What would Mardi Gras be without its parades?</strong> And what would Mardi Gras parades be without its sassy, sequined,
    irreverent dance troupes and marching clubs? In the past few years, DYI marching groups have been popping up all over.
    It’s a great way to be a part of Mardi Gras without the expense of joining a big krewe. The best of the best groups like
    to do it up big. Big costumes, big color, big hair, big glitter. Watch for these great groups on the parade route:</p>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>Alter Egos Steppers</strong> – The Alter Egos first paraded in 2017. They are famous for purple wigs and for doing good things
    for the community.</p>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>Amazons</strong> – To represent a certain “ferocity of spirit and soul,” the Amazons, some of whom are cancer survivors, don’t
    smile on their parade route. They don warrior tunics and breast armor, and, along with the Scythians (their male
    supporters), they perform formations during marches with their swords.</p>
    <img src="img/info2.jpg" class="col-md-4 float-md-start me-3 ms-md-" alt="dance&marching">
    <p class="infotexti"> <strong>The Bayou Babes of New Orleans</strong> – Founded in 2017 out of the love of Zydeco music, this co-ed marching group is known for
    their DIY costumes. Their signature throw is a hand-decorated mini pirogue. They march in the Krewe Bohème parade.</p>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>The Beyjorettes</strong> – This Beyoncé-themed dance troupe debuted at FestiGals in 2019. The city's "fiercest" parade krewe
    invites you to join the Bey-Hive. Photo by Patrick Niddrie.</p>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>Bearded Oysters</strong> – No, New Orleans hasn’t got to the point where we have real oysters dancing down the street, but we do
    have this girls’ troupe that’s more into shaking and wooing than any kind of stilted choreography. Men are also
    involved, dressed up as chefs and called “Oyster Shuckers.” Photo by Christina Peters.</p>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>Black Storyville Baby Dolls </strong>– Founded in 2014, this group throws black roses to honor the women who costumed and paraded
    in the African-American part of New Orleans’ red-light district in 1912. They also throw cigars which the first dolls
    smoked openly in public. Joining them on the route are the “Basin Street Characters.”</p>
    <p class="infotexti"><strong>Blanco Sereia</strong> – This group has a Brazilian theme. Their costumes are inspired by two Yoruba water goddesses, Oxum and
    Lemanja. BTW, blanco is a Brazilian Carnival term for marching groups that circle the block.</p>

    <h2 class="mayortitle">LaToya Cantrell</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="mayortexti">
    Hi, and welcome to our beautiful city, New Orleans !
    </p>
    <p class="mayortexti">
    Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's history.Once
    in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address
    families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding solutions to
    violent crime.Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has
    focused on her initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green
    spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid
    manufacturers and distributors.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mayortexti">
    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with Governor John
    Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's
    infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the
    Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the
    ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties,
    as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
